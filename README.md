#  Spotify Music Analysis Dashboard 
I have created an interactive Tableau dashboard exploring Spotify track features, popularity trends, genres and musical characteristics.

# 🎶 Welcome to my Spotify Analysis Project🎶
For this project I analysed the Spotify Features dataset to understand what makes certain songs more popular than others. I looked at musical attributes such as tempo, danceability, energy, valence and acousticness to see how they vary across different genres and how they influence engagement of listeners. My aim was to create insights that could support future music related decisions whether that’s playlist strategy predicting trend forecasting or planning content. 

## 🎯  Project Focus  🎯 
I worked as a data analyst exploring the Spotify dataset to identify trends that Spotify could use for future music related projects. The idea was to understand the behaviour of listeners and uncover what features of a track make it more engaging. Tableau was the best tool for this as it allowed me to build visualisations that can show a multitude of things as well as comparing track features and clearly spotting patterns that would be harder to notice in raw data. It really helps people from a technical or non technical background to distinguish what is happening in the data which is really important when presenting insights to different audiences so everyone understands the focus.

## 📊 Visualisations 📊
###  🎼 Average Popularity by Genre  🎼
This visual compares the average popularity across different Spotify genres and shows which types of music perform the best overall. From my analysis the genres that consistently appear as the most popular include Pop, Rap, Rock and Hip Hop. The chart makes it clear which genres attract the widest audience. This gives Spotify a better understanding of where listeners are most active and helps guide future decisions around content direction and marketing.

 ### ⚡ Energy vs Danceability ⚡
This chart shows how energetic and danceable different tracks are across the Spotify dataset and how these characteristics relate to listener engagement. It highlights that tracks with higher energy and stronger rhythm tend to perform better on Spotify. The visual also shows how certain genres naturally group together based on their musical features. This makes it easier to understand which styles of music are more engaging and how they connect to Spotify listeners preferences.

### 🥁 Tempo Distribution 🥁
This visual explores the tempo ranges of the most popular Spotify tracks and how different tempos influences listener engagement. A large number of high performing songs fall between 100 and 130 BPM which is a common range for mainstream music however understanding these patterns provides useful insights for a few things like playlist curation, music production and targeting specific audiences.

### 😊 Valence Across Genres exploring Popularity vs Valence 😊
This visual examines how the perceived positivity and emotion of different of songs vary across different Spotify genres by measuring their valence levels. Pop and Dance tracks tend to score higher giving them an upbeat and cheerful sound. This explains why they attract broader audiences and higher engagement. In contrast genres like Metal and Blues generally have lower valence creating a more intense or emotional listening experience that appeals to niche audiences. These insights are valuable for Spotify as they allow the platform to strategically tailor playlists, marketing campaigns and content recommendations. By understanding the emotional tone of each genre Spotify can enhance user engagement and increase listening time but deliver more personalised experiences that resonate with their listeners preferences.

### 🎤 Most Popular Artists 🎤
This visual highlights the artists with the highest average popularity on Spotify. From my analysis, the top three artists are Alexander Tansman, Anne Queffélec and Tomás Luis de Victoria. The chart clearly shows which performers consistently attract the largest audiences and maintain strong listener engagement. These insights are valuable for Spotify as they can make decisions around playlist curation, marketing strategies and content recommendations. The visual also reveals how artist popularity varies across genres and helps identify performers who resonate most effectively with listeners. By understanding these trends, Spotify can better target promotional efforts and create engaging experiences tailored to audience preferences.

### 🖥️ Dashboard Overview 🖥️ 
This section brings all the visualisations together in one interactive dashboard and gives users the ability to explore trends by genre, compare track features and understand how different musical characteristics relate to popularity on Spotify. The dashboard brings the analysis to life and makes the insights easy to interpret from different angles across multiple departments at Spotify.

## 🔍 Analysis & Key Findings 🔍
Analysing the Spotify dataset revealed several clear patterns in listener behaviour and track performance. I found Pop and Hip Hop tracks consistently appear as the most popular genres attracting the largest audiences. Songs with tempos between 100 and 130 BPM tend to perform better also suggesting that rhythm and pace play a key role in listener engagement at Spotify. Tracks that are energetic and highly danceable also tend to draw more attention whereas songs with high acousticness are generally less popular. Similarly Pop and Dance tracks have higher valence indicating they sound happier and more uplifting compared to genres such as Metal or Blues. These insights provide Spotify with actionable information to guide playlist creation and marketing strategies allowing Spotify to push content recommendations while understanding what resonates most with their listeners.  

## 💡 Why I Used Tableau 💡
I chose Tableau for this project because it allowed me to uncover patterns in a large complex dataset instead of manually sifting through thousands of rows of data which would be more time consuming. I was able to visualise trends and compare track features as well as explore relationships between different musical attributes in real time. Tableau’s interactive dashboard functionality also enabled me to present insights in a way that is accessible to both technical and non technical departments at Spotify. This makes it an ideal tool for Spotify where data driven decisions need to be communicated clearly and effectively to stakeholders with varying levels of expertise.

## 📁 Dataset 📁
This project uses the **Extension_Task_SpotifyFeatures.csv** dataset. The original Excel version was too large to upload directly to GitHub so I have provided it below.
